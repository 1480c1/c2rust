# Building the manual

1. `cargo install --git https://github.com/immunant/mdBook.git --branch
   installable` (May require `--force` if you already have mdbook
   installed. Requires custom changes to resolve symlinks, hopefully will be
   merged into upstream soon)
2. `mdbook build` in the root source directory
3. The manual should now be available in the `book` subdirectory.

# Adding to the manual

1. Add a new Markdown file somewhere in the repository.
2. Edit `manual/SUMMARY.md` and add a link to the new file.
   Use a path relative to the repository root.
3. Add the new Markdown file to the git index (`git add ...`)
4. Run `scripts/link_manual.py` from the root directory. This will create a
   symlink for the new file in the `manual/` directory. This symlink should be
   added to git as well.


## Generated docs

The `c2rust-refactor` command documentation is generated by the
`c2rust-refactor/doc/gen_command_docs.py` script. This script is run
automatically by `mdbook` and will replace `\\\{{#refactor_commands}}` in the
`manual/c2rust-refactor/commands.md` file with the autogenerated command
documentation. The generated file is not written to disk, but is directly
translated into the output format via the mdbook renderer.
